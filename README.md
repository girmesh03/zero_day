# Using Vagrant

## Vagrant. 

Vagrant is a tool that sits on top of a VM provider. Again, we chose to use VirtualBox as a provider, but other providers exist out there and Vagrant offers the possibilty to use dfferent providers (More info here). Just like VirtualBox, we choose to use Vagrant because it is free, reliable and well maintained. Keep in mind that the purpose here is to use Virtual environments, and both VirtualBox and Vagrant are just means to achieve this purpose.

## VirtualBox.

VirtualBox is a Virtual Machine provider. The virtual machines themselves will be spawned using VirtualBox. VirtualBox is free and lightweight, which make it a perfect choice for us.

## VirtualBox and Vagrant.

VirtualBox and Vagrant together allow you to manage and ship isolated development environments. Those isolated environments in the context of the school (and in the future, in the context of a company) allow you to match the environment we use to automatically check your work.
Although both VirtualBox and Vagrant are widely used in the industry, it doesnâ€™t mean it is the only means to achieve virtualization, and other tools exist with their pros and cons.
